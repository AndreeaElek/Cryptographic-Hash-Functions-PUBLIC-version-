All the implementations have the required additional libraries and modules mentioned at the top of the code (#include). The OpenSSL-Win64 must be installed. 
The .ddl and .lib files must all be added in the same folder as the C code for the implementation. In this case, they are already provided in this folder.
There are also .exe files included for each hash function. This can be used to test the function/ see their functionality, for the test string already added in the C file. If you want to test them on a different string/text, the string must be directly modified in the main function, where the hash function is called. The C file must the be compiled again before execution. The following commands can be used in powershell for the compilation and execution of the files (depending on where the OpneSSL-Win64 containing the headers is installed in your computer, the path might need to be modified accordingly):

!Note: if running the execution command in the powershell doesn't show a result, or the terminal closes imediatlly after it finished the hashing, you should run it the terminal of the application used to modify the code (ex: Visual Studio Code). The resulting hash will be visible there.
